## Introduction

ADManager Plus is a web-based Active Directory management and reporting platform built for administrators who need speed, control, and auditability at scale. It streamlines the full identity lifecycle—user, group, and computer provisioning; role- and OU-based delegation; and bulk operations across thousands of objects—without relying on fragile one-off scripts.

For advanced environments, ADManager Plus adds workflow-driven change control with approvals, request tracking, and detailed event logging. You can standardize joiner/mover/leaver processes, enforce naming and attribute policies, and automate common tasks such as password resets, account disablement, group membership updates, and home folder/profile handling. Scheduled automation, templates, and CSV-based imports help keep directory data consistent while reducing helpdesk load.

Reporting is geared toward compliance and operational insight: inactive and stale accounts, privileged group membership, password and lockout trends, last logon activity, and attribute completeness. Reports can be filtered, exported, and delivered automatically to stakeholders on a schedule.

Operationally, the console is optimized for daily admin work—advanced searches, reusable filters, and controlled delegation so tier-1 teams can perform only approved actions. In hybrid deployments, it can also extend management to Microsoft 365/Azure AD-connected identities and related objects where supported, enabling consistent processes across on-prem and cloud.

Designed for professionals, ADManager Plus emphasizes least-privilege administration, repeatable processes, and measurable outcomes: fewer manual touches, faster onboarding, cleaner directories, and stronger governance.
